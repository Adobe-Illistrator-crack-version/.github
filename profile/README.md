- **Precision and Clarity**: Each vector object is defined by its geometry, enabling precise control over lines, curves, and shapes.

#### **2. Advanced Drawing Tools**
- **Pen Tool**: Illustratorâ€™s Pen Tool allows for the creation of precise paths with curves and straight lines. This tool is essential for creating complex shapes and outlines.
- **Pencil and Brush Tools**: Allows freehand drawing, mimicking real-life drawing tools like pens and brushes, which can be adjusted for size, pressure, and other variables.
- **Shape Tools**: A variety of basic shapes such as rectangles, circles, polygons, and stars can be drawn easily and customized.
